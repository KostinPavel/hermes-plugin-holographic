"""A rerank call asks no more of the endpoint than it answers within rerank_timeout (2026-10-29).

Requirement: a cross-encoder on a CPU scores the pairs at a steady speed, so its time grows with everything it is
sent. Mia's llama-server (jina-reranker-v2, 2 threads) answers 5 short facts in 0.4 s, 15 in 1.2 s and 40 in 3.3 s —
over the default rerank_timeout of 3.0 s. The call failed, recall went on without the reranker and the endpoint was
paused for 60 s and longer, on exactly the large pools a big store gives. Once the endpoint's speed is known, a call
sends only as many of the first candidates as it scores in half the timeout; the rest keep their order behind the
scored ones, as the tail beyond rerank_top_k always did. A timeout after the connection was ready teaches the same:
the next call sends about half of what did not come back in time. A timeout before the connection was ready teaches
nothing. A fast endpoint is sent the whole pool, as before.

The fake endpoint below stands in for the opener: it marks the connection ready, as net's connection does, then
takes `per_char` seconds per character of every query-document pair it was sent."""
