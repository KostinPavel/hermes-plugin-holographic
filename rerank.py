"""Second-stage rescoring: optional, offline-safe, off by default. A Cohere-compatible `/v1/rerank` endpoint (the
de-facto standard; OpenAI has no rerank API at all) reorders the final candidate pool after the blend. One synchronous
HTTP call at recall time; the only state kept is the endpoint's pause and its last measured speeds, in memory.

Tested against llama-server (`--reranking --embedding --pooling rank`). Any server that answers the Cohere shape
(``{"results": [{"index", "relevance_score"}]}``) without a key should work; the client sends no key, so a cloud API
that requires one (Cohere, Jina) refuses every call, and TEI's own ``/rerank`` answers a bare list, which is refused
as malformed. Either way the endpoint is paused and recall keeps the off order.

Guardrails (from RFC #9):
- off by default (``rerank: false``); behaviour and scores exactly 0.13.4's when off;
- a query holding a secret (``_secret_in``) → no call at all;
- any failure gives exactly the recall of rerank off, one log line of the error category, the endpoint goes to
  backoff 60 s doubling to 900 s (_PAUSE_FIRST / _PAUSE_MAX);
- ``rerank_timeout`` defaults to 3.0 (issue #5: a slow local endpoint is the normal case; this is recall's only
  protection, there is no catch-up);
- a call sends no more than the endpoint has shown it scores in half the timeout (RERANK_TIME_SHARE);
- the reranker judges the pair's text only — no hrr_vector / trust / decay in the request.
